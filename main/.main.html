    	  		<h2>Programmer | Designer | Developer</h2>

Well, as a computer science student I would always lime to introduce myself as a programmer, designer and a developer. Its because well of course I am...<br><br><br>

> 🧾 >As a programmer,<br>
 capable of handling mid level C as well as basic level java and some node.js in terms of software programming...<br>
In terms of hardware programming I am pretty much capable of handling Arduino, NodeMCU development boards and could handle some basic level IoT projects...<br><br><br>

> 👨‍💻 As a designer,<br>
Well as a designer I am capable of handling some graphic designing softwares as well as typographic designing (primarily fontLab and fontForge)<br>
And as well as I could design some no code websites.. Well of course I have a website for real as well as a website is being under designing for my brand name **TESNIC** and soon will be released for real...!<br>
	Not only no code websites, I m pretty much capable of full code website designing as well...Like there are many websites designed by me and which were deployed to the web via GitHub pages(Like this one of course)....<br><br><br>

> 📀 As a developer<br>
And of course as a developer I could handle Arduino, NodeMCU, IoT projects development and as well as am currently a telegram bot designer and developer....<br>
Yes of course I am a telegram bot developer...**TESNICO** is my primary bot's name -Which was of course derived from **Tesnic**... Tesnico is currently under development as of 10 04 2023(today) and is not 24/7 online... It is locally hosted on my system and not in any clouds.... But Tesnico's source code and files are publically available at my Tesnico repo...<br><br>

    	  	<h2>Role model</h2>
			<p>
			If you ask me who my role model is, then the answer definitely will be ***NIKOLA TESLA***!,  and that certainly is not out of neither empathy nor symathy but completely outta ***RESPECT!***....<br><br>

			Nikola Tesla is the biggest scientist who had made 100's N 1000's of inventions, yet unrecognized during his time and was neglected by everyone exceot so.e people... He was the biggest man who had always dedicated his whole for research and invention... He was the man whose 68% inventions were used world wide... And he is the man who revolutionized the world with his AC current tech.. And who is there more worthy to be a role model✨️.
			
				Well..Moreover that why I like him is because of that we both had some similarities and I think by regarding him as my role model I could achieve more than a lot...<br><br><br>

    	  </section>
    	  <section>
    	  		<p>
    	  			So basically that's all about me.... But well,of course its not all about me but about TESNIC as well...<br>
					So what's TESNIC any way....<br><br>

    	  		</p>
    	  </section>
    	  <section>
    	  		⭕️ <h2>TESNIC</h2>
    	  		 Tesnic is something more complex!but not either...<br> It is just a simple name under I am releasing my projects activities and whatever I am releasing publically for this world to see about me... It's almost like my brand name...<br> Or a pen name...(So
    	  		 ething like that)<br><br>
    	  		 Tesnic represents myself and me only...<br><br>
				Now then, lemme introduce where Tesnic came from...

			Well, TesNic has two parts as you see..Tes and Nic... <br>
			Tes as in Tesla and Nic as in Nikola... Yes of course TesNic is derived from Nikola Tesla.... The man whom I call my role model :><br><br>

			Now then,<br>
			Why wasn't it NicTes!<br>
		    It's because I am a fan of japaneese contents... And in Japanese they say second name or initial or family name -whatever it is- as first name.. And thus Nikola Tesla became Tesla Nikola and thus TesNic :]|...<br><br>

			What all do I have under Tesnic currently?<br>
			Currently Tesnico is the only thing under the flag Tesnic.. And am working on a blog site which will soon be released named TechNic Which is derived from tech+Tesnic words...
